# Eucatas Trophe
The word "Eucatastrophe" sounds ominous because it contains the word "catastrophe". So what if we just break the word apart?

The result is:
    
    Eucatas Trophe
    
The original word was not changed thus preserving its sense of history. The change in pronounciation makes it much less ominous.
